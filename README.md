# Sprollspy-Collapse
Scrollspy ability that works with Bootstrap collapse as the nav.<br/>

<strong>Requirements:</strong><br/>
jQuery

<strong>Instructions:</strong> <br/>
gridTop - Change the decimal value. e.g. .45 = 45% down the page.<br/>
gridBottom - Change the decimal value. e.g. .65 = 65% down the page.<br/>

Titles on the page should have an id. Elements in the Collapse will need a href element of the respective id.<br/>
