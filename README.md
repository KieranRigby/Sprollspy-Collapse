# Sprollspy-Collapse
Scrollspy ability that works with Bootstrap collapse as the nav.

<strong>Requirements:</strong>
jQuery

Instructions:
gridTop - Change the decimal value. e.g. .45 = 45% down the page.
gridBottom - Change the decimal value. e.g. .65 = 65% down the page.

Titles on the page should have an id. Elements in the Collapse will need a href element of the respective id.

Can be optimised further with throttling, this is only the 1st version.
